# PlantsVSZombies
This is a rather basic version of the iOS and Android game, Plants Vs. Zombies.
This program gives me the opportunity to play with the "adding" and "deleting" aspects of the arrays within Java.
Thus, the user is able to add and delete plants, along with their associating sunglight values.
An IBIO class is also assosciated with this program in order to take input from the user.
The IBIO file has been attached with the Plants VS. Zombies program.
